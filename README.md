# kaggle-no-show-medical-appointments
This Jupyter notebook analyzes a dataset from Kaggle - No-Show medical appointments(Brazil).

The dataset used is a collection of some 110K medical appointments of patients in Brazil. The records include different characteristics of patients, along with a no-show record, which here is most important to us. The various given factors will be used to relate the reason for no-shows to these appointments. Factors such as age, day on which appointment falls and wait time!

These above factors are realized using visualizations, using Pandas and Matplotlib.
